# Sophie.Cache
A set of proxy classes for CacheManager to simplify its usage

A simple cache implementation that makes use of the CacheManager framework and tools.  I may plan to implement my own someday so I created an abstraction that will allow me to do that.  

For now, this is an in-memory-only implementation.
